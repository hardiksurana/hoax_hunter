Cape Town, South Africa - The Government of South Africa has unofficially announced that President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are relocating to South Africa after Obama's term ends in January. The Obamas reportedly are leaving their daughters and dogs behind with Michelle Obama's mother.  Local papers stated that the President has been concerned with Donald Trump as President, and that living in Africa would be more fun and provide new leadership opportunities.  The Trudeaus invited the Obama family to Canada, but President Obama wanted to go back to his "birth home."  The South African Government further stated that President Obama is actually the love child of Nelson Mandela, and plans to run for President there.  The Obama Administration denies the reports of the South African government as being patently false. The President accuses the government of simply trying to promote tourism by taking over for Trump as the leader of the debunked Birther Movement.  Mike _Peril@aol.com
