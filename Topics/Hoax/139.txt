Archaeologists worldwide are excited at the recent find in Jerusalem of what is believed to be the last prophecy of the prophet Daniel. It reads as follows:  Last Prophecy of Daniel  And behold in the last days men shall gaze onto glowing boxes and be befuddled. They shall sit in crowded places and stare onto tablets and talk onto themselves and laugh even as harlots after a busy weekend. They shall be confused as to their nature and their private parts and doubt the innocence of their attractions to one another.  Men shall seek to beget children by men and women seek likewise to beget their own flesh from their own flesh. They shall believe all that they read and are told without question and be unable to discern between dream and reality.  They shall be as one, sleep-walking, knowing not whence they come or where they goest and yet all shall be of one mind. And that one mind shall worship and obey the Evil One that will be the mind's embodiment.... the Lord of Power and celebrity ... Lucifer.  So let it be said. So shall it be and when ye see these things happen know that the end is nigh.
