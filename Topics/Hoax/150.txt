After being accused of trying to make America Great Again by grabbing another pussy, the man who is trying to break the Guinness Book of world records for the most lies told during a presidential campaign, Donald Trump is crying "Wrong" again!  Just when you thought Donald Trump had more lawsuits than total number of sniffles ever recorded during a live speech, more women have come forward to prove he's pointing the wrong finger by showing him their middle ones.  Sexual Assault accusations are pouring in like Viagra Falls between Trumps legs. Donald Trump has been responding by abusing the word "Sue" because it's a womans' name, while his wife Melania Trump continues defending poor little Donald like the mother in denial making excuses for her baby boy who keeps crying "Wrong" while getting in trouble.  Voters fear Donald Trump is so full of malarkey, it's making him turn more orange. Donald Trump just received the 2016 Pinocchio award while donors ran to GOP customer service asking for a refund on the broken product they purchased. The few GOP members that have Donald's back, continue to look for their balls they lost on Trumps golf course. Donald Trump's response to every accusation is "wrong"!
