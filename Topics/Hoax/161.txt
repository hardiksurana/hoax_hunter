He has ordered a full congressional investigation into SNL and their libelous so called humour.  Alec Baldwin seems to be the main target, but all Trumphole impersonators are included in the arraignment deposition.

Satire writers everywhere are bracing for the worst with an underground resistance movement located in secret nuclear bunkers being mooted as their 'last stand'.
